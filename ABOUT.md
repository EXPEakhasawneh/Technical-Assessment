# A Little about this app

I chose NodeJS as a server-side because I feel confident writing JavaScript. For front-end I picked React, let you write elegant code and every thing is divided into components, Moreover, it's declarative programming, I think, better when you deal with html & CSS.

What you see when you land on this page main deals from API. Otherwise, you would pick you destination just type your target city. Optionally, you could pick how long your vacation would be or what's your hotel preferences (4 star or 5 star, etc..).

I thought myself I used React before where I used to have different redirection pages, while in this app I want to take the advantage of vDOM which React special about then realised I'm just at the beginning. On the other hand, faced some limitation trying to pass params in fetch function ended up pass them directly in API url. Moreover, the test before divid components was complaining in production because of the same.
