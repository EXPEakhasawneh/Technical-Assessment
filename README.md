# Technical-Assessment

This application for rendering Expedia offers that called from Expedia API https://offersvc.expedia.com/offers/v2/getOffers?scenario=deal-finder&page=foo&uid=foo&productType=Hotel

I chose NodeJS as a server-side because I feel confident writing JavaScript code. So you could guess why I picked React for front-end, let you write elegant code and every thing is divided into components which I think that helps to write a clean & dynamic code. 

## Prerequisite

* npm installed along with NodeJS

## Getting Started

1. Clone repo

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/EXPEakhasawneh/Technical-Assessment.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```console
$ npm install
```

3. Build App locally (-w will let you see changes instantaneously)

```console
$ webpack -w
```

4. Start the server (use nodemon instead to monitor changes on index.js)

```console
$ node index.js
```
